Aim: Study of the features of firewall in providing network security and to set Firewall Security in windows.
### 🔹 **1. What is a Firewall?**
* A firewall protects a computer by **blocking unauthorized access** and **allowing safe communication**.
* It monitors **incoming and outgoing network traffic**.

### 🔹 **2. Types of Firewalls in Windows**
* **Windows Firewall** – basic version, allows or blocks programs/services.
* **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security (WFAS)** – advanced version; allows configuration based on **ports, IP addresses, and protocols**.

### 🔹 **3. Default Firewall Rules**

  * File & Printer sharing
  * Remote desktop and management
* **Outbound traffic** = allowed by default.
* **Inbound traffic** = blocked unless it’s a response to an allowed request.

### 🔹 **4. Handling Blocked Programs**
* If a program tries to access the network and is blocked,
  → Windows shows a notification.
  → You can add an **exception** to allow it in the future.

### 🔹 **5. New Features in Windows 7 Firewall**
* **Full-Stealth Mode** – hides your system from hackers performing OS fingerprinting.
* **Boot-time Filtering** – firewall starts as soon as the network interface becomes active.
* **Network Location Awareness (NLA)** – automatically assigns security rules based on the network type.

### 🔹 **6. Network Profiles**
1. **Public** – most restrictive (for cafés, airports).
2. **Home/Work (Private)** – for trusted networks.
3. **Domain** – for computers connected to a corporate network (Active Directory).
Each profile has different firewall settings.

### 🔹 **7. How to Open and Configure Firewall**
1. Click **Start → Control Panel → Windows Firewall**.
2. Check if it’s **ON** for both private and public networks.
3. To allow a program:
   * Click **“Allow a program or feature through Windows Firewall.”**
