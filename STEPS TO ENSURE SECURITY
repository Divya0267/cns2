Aim - To study and ensure the security of a web browser (Mozilla Firefox).

### 🔹 **1. Importance of Browser Security**
* The browser is your **main gateway to the internet**.
* It’s also the **first line of defence** against online threats.
* Adjusting security settings can **protect your personal data**.

### 🔹 **2. Common Browser Vulnerabilities**
* Add-ons like **Java, Flash, ActiveX** can be risky.
* Hackers exploit these tools to attack your PC.

### 🔹 **3. Steps for Safe Browsing**
#### **a. Deactivate ActiveX (for IE/Edge)**
* Rarely used now; can allow malicious sites into your system.
* Disable unless absolutely necessary.
#### **b. Disable or Limit JavaScript**
* Used by most sites but can also deliver malware.
* Disable globally or **whitelist only trusted sites** like Google Docs or YouTube.
* This reduces ads, pop-ups, and speeds up browsing.
#### **c. Delete Cookies Regularly**
* Cookies store login info and track browsing.
* **First-party cookies**: from the site you visit.
* **Third-party cookies**: from advertisers tracking you.
* Block or delete third-party cookies often.
* Avoid saving passwords in the browser.
#### **d. Be Cautious with Add-ons**
* Install only **trusted extensions** (e.g., Ad blockers).
* Remove unnecessary ones to prevent malware injection.

### 🔹 **4. Firefox Security Settings – Step-by-Step**
#### **Step 1: Control Downloads**
* Go to **Menu → Options → General**.
* Under *Downloads*, check **“Always ask me where to save files.”**
  → Prevents automatic malware downloads.
#### **Step 2: Stop Tracking**
* Go to **Privacy & Security → Tracking Protection.**
* Enable **“Always apply Do Not Track.”**
  → Stops advertisers and websites from tracking you.
#### **Step 3: Manage History**
* In **History**, select **“Firefox will never remember history”**
  OR
  Use **custom settings** → Check **“Always use private browsing mode.”**
  → Automatically deletes history, cookies, and downloads.
#### **Step 4: Improve Security Settings**
* Under **Security**, ensure all options are checked:
  * Warn you about malicious sites.
  * Block dangerous downloads.
  * Warn when add-ons try to install.
  * Block deceptive content.
#### **Step 5: Set a Master Password**
* Under **Logins and Passwords**, set up a **Master Password**.
  → Protects stored credentials if multiple users share the system.
  ⚠️ **Do not let the browser remember passwords.**
